# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. There are many like it, but these are mine!

## Scripts
- manage_dotfiles.sh: Mark it as executable and run it from the root of the repo. Use the deploy command to send the to their respective locations. Use the commit command to bring in changes into the repo for possibly being commited for the future.

## Additional Notes
- The .zshrc file requires a fair amount of manual installation of plugins. The first one being OMZ, and then the other plugins as well
- Copy of VSCode User settings.json is included as vscode/settings.json
  - These fonts seem to be the best: 'JetBrainsMono Nerd Font', 'Hack Nerd Font Mono'. 
  - Theme (installed as an extension) is jelly.
