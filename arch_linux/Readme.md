Things have really advanced a ton in this field and linux is becoming many people's daily drivers.

# Why install arch from scratch? Why not start with something like Omarchy and pare it down?

It also prepares you to debug any issues that comes up down the line. Also, after running dependable but stale Pop_OS for over 3 years, I'm ready for something more cutting edge.
